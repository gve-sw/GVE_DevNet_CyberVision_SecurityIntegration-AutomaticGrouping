# INTEGRATION OF QUERYING UMBRELLA + "PROCESSING" THE EVENTS

'''
This script integrates the reputation gathered from Umbrella with the processing of the events. The word "processing" here
means adding the DNS query into the domains_DB, which is the json file that includes the malicious domains that have been queried

This script is divided into 3 functions:
- Funcion 1 (store_info()):
    DESCRIPTION: stores the modified information of the domains in a separate json file (that constantly updates itself)
    INPUTS (1): Python structure that contains the information about the domains

- Function 2 (get_position()):
    DESCRIPTION: gets the index position of a specific domain inside the domains_DB structure, which is the data coming from the json file
        that contains the information about the domains, IPs, and dates (the reason will be better understood in the integration_process() function)
    INPUTS (2): domain that wants to be checked, domains_DB
    OUTPUTS (1): index position of the specific domain

- Function 3 (integration_process()):
    DESCRIPTION: first, it checks whether this is the first time that the malicious domain has been queried. If it is, the domain is added as a new
        one into the database. If it is not, the database is updated with the new information
    INPUTS (2): domain to be treated, domains_DB
    OUTPUTS (1): add information from the new domain into the domains_DB structure (and consequently the json file)
